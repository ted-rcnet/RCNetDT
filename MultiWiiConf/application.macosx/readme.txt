This application was created on Windows, which does not properly support setting files as  "executable", a necessity for applications on Mac OS X.

To fix this, use the Terminal on Mac OS X, and from this
directory, you could : 

- Run the "Patch" application

or

- type the following:

chmod +x MultiWiiConf.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub
